### Steps to Reveal the Password Using Page Source and JavaScript

1. **Open Page Source**:  
   - Press `Ctrl+U` (Windows/Linux) or `Command+Option+U` (Mac) to open the page source.  
   - Alternatively, right-click on the page and select **View Page Source**.

2. **Search for the Password**:  
   - Press `Ctrl+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Command+F` (Mac) to open the search bar.  
   - Type `"password"` to locate the relevant code in the source.

3. **Find the Password Check Logic**:  
   - Look for a function that checks the entered password, such as `checkPW()`.  
   - In this example, the function contains an `if` statement like this:  
     ```javascript
     if (el.value == unescape("r%20i%20g%20h%20t%20") + "" + "p" + "w" + "" + "9d9f7fba4")
     ```

4. **Decode the Password**:  
   - Open the browser console by pressing `F12` and navigating to the **Console** tab.  
   - Type the following code in the console and press Enter:  
     ```javascript
     unescape("r%20i%20g%20h%20t%20") + "" + "p" + "w" + "" + "9d9f7fba4"
     ```

5. **Reveal the Password**:  
   - The console will output the password:  
     ```
     r i g h t pw9d9f7fba4
     ```

6. **Use the Password**:  
   - Enter the decoded password (`r i g h t pw9d9f7fba4`) in the password field and press **OK**.  

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the steps.
